# Computation Learning - Project


In this project, we implemented and evaluated the model - dynamic boosted ensemble learning method based on random
forest (DBRF) that was proposed by X. Ren et al.

### Execution Requirements
- All files should be in the same directory, including the classification_datasets folder.

### Execution Instruction
- To execute the code, one should run the Jupyter Notebook files - 
* DBRF_Code.ipynb - Code to execute and evaluate the DBRF model.
* Extra-Trees-Code.ipynb - Code to execute and evaluate the Extra-Trees model.
